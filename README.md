# Multithreaded-WebCrawler

### Project Overview

In this project, you will develop a multithreaded web crawler in C that can efficiently fetch,
parse, and process web pages from the internet. The goal is to utilize multiple threads to
improve the performance and efficiency of the web crawling process.

### Problem Statement

The internet is vast and ever-growing. Traditional single-threaded web crawlers are not
efficient enough to handle the volume of information available. The challenge is to develop
a web crawler that can navigate the web efficiently by fetching multiple pages in parallel,
thus significantly reducing the time required to crawl a set of URLs.
